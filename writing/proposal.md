# Project Proposal
##### Group members: Urszula Oszczapinska, Favour Ojo, & Kyrie Doniz

### *Project idea*
  For our final group project, we will be creating a program that provides an individual movie options within a movie theatre. More precisely, the program will provide the individual with a selection of released, and current movies playing, a brief summary of the movie, the top three actors in the film, the genre of the film, the showing times, choice of picking their seat, the rate of the movie (e.g., rated PG) and the ticket cost per person. The individual will be provided with the total cost, and the ability to pay at time of purchase, or be provided the opportunity to pay in cash at the theatre. The individual will be given a receipt, and a proof of purchase at the end, if one was made.

### *Motivation*
  With working together on assignments we most likely should not have, Kyrie, Favour and I (Urszula) decided to work together as we work well together, and offer each other insight on different aspects of programming. We troubleshoot together, we provide suggestions, and we have worked outside of class to help each other understand the concepts taught in class. On another note, we decided on this particular project as it will utilize code that we have been practicing to implement all semester long, as well as its application to the real-world where individuals want an efficient way to know about what movies are currently in theatre without having to go on the site, and browse through options.

### *Expected Use of Java*
  We expect that we will receive input from the customer for what movie option, time, type of ticket, what seat they want, and whether or not they want a receipt. We think that we will be putting the movie information along with showtimes in a readable input file, for easy access. Additionally, we will be printing back information confirming the movie, genre, top three actors in the film, rating, time, and ticket selection, as well as overall cost. A goal of ours would probably be to have an option for a sold-out show time or an unavailable seat option, so that our code has a unique aspect each time it is run. Lastly, we hope to be able to have the ability to add in fun features like a coupon after a certain price threshold is reached and the opportunity to view the movie for free, using the Random class to randomly generate this instances between when it is run.

  In our code, we will be importing the user-defined packages Scanner, File, FileNotFoundException, and Date. The Scanner package allows us to receive any input from the user. For instance, we will be receiving the type of movie the user would like to see, the ticket type, and also the seat number. The File allows us to read into any text file we connect to our code. The text file we create will probably include the movie titles we choose to use. The FileNotFoundException package will let us know if the file the user tries to read into is not found. With the Date package, the code will automatically provide the current date for us without having the write it ourselves.

### *Sources*
These are the sources that we have referenced for the project. We will loosely base our project and program off of these helpful resources, which makes our project feasible within the given time constraints we have.
